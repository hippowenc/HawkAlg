## Necessary Downloads
- Please make sure you have python3 downloaded and running on your machine. This can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/ and you can verify that it's installed by running: python3 --version from your terminal...at least you can on mac, the windows command might be slightly different
- Install git: https://git-scm.com/downloads this will be our version control system to make sure we can go back to an older version incase someone screws something up
- Make sure you have your own Integrated Development Environment. This can be whichever one you'd like as long as it supports Python. I personally recommend PyCharm, which is free with your student email, or VScode which is also free.
- https://gemini.google/students/ you'll likely want an ai to help you and gemini is free for a year for students! ðŸŽ‰
- We will likely install other software later, ex: Database, frontend engine, but for now that should be it.
