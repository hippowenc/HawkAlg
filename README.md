## Necessary Downloads
- Please make sure you have python3 downloaded and running on your machine. This can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/ and you can verify that it's installed by running: python3 --version from your terminal...at least you can on mac, the windows command might be slightly different
- Install git: https://git-scm.com/downloads this will be our version control system to make sure we can go back to an older version incase someone screws something up
- Make sure you have your own Integrated Development Environment. This can be whichever one you'd like as long as it supports Python. I personally recommend PyCharm, which is free with your student email, or VScode which is also free.
- https://gemini.google/students/ you'll likely want an ai to help you and gemini is free for a year for students! ðŸŽ‰
- We will likely install other software later, ex: Database, frontend engine, but for now that should be it.

## Getting Started:
These videos are not comprehensive but should help get you started. I'd recommend 
- Python: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw , python cheat sheet linked here: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/11eg5af/beginners_python_cheat_sheets_updated/
- git: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE , https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf
- Missing semester: https://missing.csail.mit.edu/ this video is from MIT and focuses on teaching you everything about CS that isn't taught in school. I'd the Command line and git lectures are both helpful
